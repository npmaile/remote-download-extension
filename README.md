# Remote Download Extension
browser extension (working on firefox, but probably elsewhere since it uses the proper standard)
made for downloading things directly on a remote machine
requires the go daemon running on the remote machine to work

todo: 
* add cookies and useragent spoofing to daemon to download files behind logins
* configuration page in browser
